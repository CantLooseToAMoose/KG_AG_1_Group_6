Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.

Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home.

The Lemon Lovers Cookbook The Chicago Sun-Times  Peg Bailey has a passion for lemons. Having lived  all over the world, Bailey is able to cull the best national dishes  from places such as Greece, Malta,  England, and her home in Virginia for The  Lemon Lovers Cookbook. The recipes  are never overly complicated, and most  are ideal for weekday cooking. Exotic  fare such as Aegean shrimp and  caviar mousse exist peacefully with all-American staples such as  carrot cake and lemon bars.   Easy Refrigerator Lemon Cookies  These cookies are great in the summer with a  bowl of fresh fruit. Plan ahead,  though, as you have to leave the dough in  the refrigerator for several hours  before baking."""^^xsd:string .

And whether you decide to pick your own or buy from a favorite roadside vendor, serving fruit with any meal is, well, a berry good idea. Not only do fruits make a colorful and flavorful accompaniment to breakfast, lunch or dinner, they make a refreshing and healthy snack in the middle of a hot day or under a welcoming shady tree on an outing with family or friends.  HELPFUL HINTS Storing berries: After selecting healthy-looking berries - you'll want to avoid bruised or moldy fruit of any kind - refrigerate them in a single layer, loosely covered. To freeze, arrange washed berries in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in freezer until solid. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag or container, leaving half-an-inch at the top. Return to freezer.  Preparing a platter: You'll want at least three types of fruit for an attractive platter."^^xsd:string .

I think it would be better with twice as much garlic. I boiled my zucchini slices for about 3 minutes so they were partially cooked. I wanted to make sure they were soft in the finished dish or I knew the kids wouldn't eat them. ;) The cottage cheese provides a slightly tangy note. I think we would have preferred ricotta, but that is personal taste. I use my 11x7 baking dish and got 6 pieces the size of what you see in my photos. Both of the guys ate two so it fed 4 of us, and I double the meat. Adjust the recipe accordingly for your family."^^xsd:string .

The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle.

If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?)

The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling.", "Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom.", "This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens.", "Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles.",

That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash.", "Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn.",

If anyone attempts this recipe and uses 1/4 cup of the hot pepper flakes you will probably not be able to eat it if you cannot handle hot and spicy food. Believe me I am an amateur Cajun Chef and I could eat the dish but most people could not handle it. I will make this dish because it is rather quick and it is a one dish meal.
