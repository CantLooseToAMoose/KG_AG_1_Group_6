    "Now for the construction of the KG we need some way to link recipes to their nutrition however nutrition can have more than one entry for a dish, but these are not uniquely traceable back to their original recipe thus I cant identify which nutrition of a dish belongs to a specific recipe, therefore I assume each dish has the same nutrition but can have several recipes otherwise it would be impossible or too difficult to identify wich belong to which. Therefore I will also drop duplicate entries in the nutrition table to be inline with this assumption of only having one nutrition for a dish. After dropping I will perform a left outerjoin on recipes with nutrition to make one table for ease of knowledge graph construction."
