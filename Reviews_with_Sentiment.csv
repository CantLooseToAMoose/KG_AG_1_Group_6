377.0,7303.0,4105.0,Bill de Bruler,I would rate this one a five-star if the hot pepper flakes were omitted. I would omit the hot pepper flakes and use 3 cans of tomatoes and add 1 can of tomato and green chile's. Also for the next time I prepare the recipe I will devein and shell the shrimp then sprinkle cajun spice mix and let the shrimp marinate in it. If anyone attempts this recipe and uses 1/4 cup of the hot pepper flakes you will probably not be able to eat it if you cannot handle hot and spicy food. Believe me I am an amateur Cajun Chef and I could eat the dish but most people could not handle it. I will make this dish because it is rather quick and it is a one dish meal. I will however change it as stated in the beginning of this comment/rating.,2001-01-29 15:56:29+00:00,2001-01-29 15:56:29+00:00,positive,0.9
